Important Points:

1) Always implement Backtracking: It hugely improves the convergence speed.

2) For backtracking to work properly, you need to have the likelihood normalized with the number of observations.

3) The correct way to terminate the optimization algorithm is to check the differnece between primal and dual objective values.
